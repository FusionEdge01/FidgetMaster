  <p>FusionEdge ("we", "our", or "us") built the Fidget Master game. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the game.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <li>Level completions</li>
    <li>In-app behavior patterns</li>

  </ul>

  <p>This data is anonymous and cannot be used to personally identify you.</p>

    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>App usage data</li>
    <li>Crash logs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This information may be used to deliver personalized or non-personalized ads based on your preferences and location (where applicable).</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyze gameplay behavior and improve game modes and features</li>
    <li>Fix bugs and optimize performance</li>
    <li>Serve relevant advertisements</li>
    <li>Ensure the app runs properly across different devices</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do not sell any personal information.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following third-party services, which have their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics (Google)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google AdMob (Google Ads)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Fidget Master is designed for general audiences. However, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your country). If we discover that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>
  <p>Parents or guardians who believe their child has provided us with personal information can contact us at the email below.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your deviceâ€™s ad settings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>

  </ul>
  <p>You can also reset your advertising ID from your device settings.</p>
  <p>You may disable analytics tracking by disabling data collection within your device settings, depending on the platform.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no system can be 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</p>
